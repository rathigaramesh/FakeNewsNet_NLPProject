He says he also got a couple death threats and had to consider switching phone numbers.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180316135610im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9013181&c3=&c4=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/03/16/ohio-student-suspended-for-staying-in-class-during-walkouts.html&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.2&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180316135610im_/http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/bg/270/152/default.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180316135610im_/http://metrics.foxnews.com/b/ss/foxnews/1/H22.1--NS/1521206955504?pageName=us:subsection:article&g=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/03/16/ohio-student-suspended-for-staying-in-class-during-walkouts.html", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180316135610im_/http://a57.foxnews.com/www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/images/feed/associated-press/2018/03/16/270/152/ContentBroker_contentid-c785ee7dee9547668133386861dd916c.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180316135610im_/http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-801796h&cg=0&cc=1&si=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/03/16/ohio-student-suspended-for-staying-in-class-during-walkouts.html&ts=noscript&rnd=1521206955504", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180316135610im_/http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/03/16/270/152/694940094001_5752719248001_5752705555001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180316135610im_/http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180316135610im_/http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Associated Press"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180316135610/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/03/16/ohio-student-suspended-for-staying-in-class-during-walkouts.html", "title": "Ohio student suspended for staying in class during walkouts", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Ohio student suspended for staying in class during walkouts", "description": "An Ohio high school student says he tried to remain nonpolitical during school walkouts over gun violence and was suspended for a day because he stayed in a classroom instead of joining protests or the alternative, a study hall.", "dc.description": "An Ohio high school student says he tried to remain nonpolitical during school walkouts over gun violence and was suspended for a day because he stayed in a classroom instead of joining protests or the alternative, a study hall.", "dcterms.abstract": "An Ohio high school student says he tried to remain nonpolitical during school walkouts over gun violence and was suspended for a day because he stayed in a classroom instead of joining protests or the alternative, a study hall.", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2018-03-16", "dcterms.created": "2018-03-16 09:17:37 EDT", "dcterms.modified": "2018-03-16 09:17:37 EDT", "dc.source": "Associated Press", "dc.identifier": "c3d262d4-8da5-4bcc-81df-abae8ced2fae", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "us", "og": {"title": "Ohio student suspended for staying in class during walkouts", "description": "An Ohio high school student says he tried to remain nonpolitical during school walkouts over gun violence and was suspended for a day because he stayed in a classroom instead of joining protests or the alternative, a study hall.", "type": "article", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180316135610im_/http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180316135610/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/03/16/ohio-student-suspended-for-staying-in-class-during-walkouts.html", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "fb": {"pages": 15704546335, "app_id": 113186182048399}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/US/EDUCATION", "classification-isa": "education", "twitter": {"site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary", "title": "Ohio student suspended for staying in class during walkouts", "description": "An Ohio high school student says he tried to remain nonpolitical during school walkouts over gun violence and was suspended for a day because he stayed in a classroom instead of joining protests or the alternative, a study hall.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180316135610im_/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/03/16/ohio-student-suspended-for-staying-in-class-during-walkouts.html", "creator": "@foxnews"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "robots": "noarchive, noodp"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521129600.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
