Extraordinary observations require extraordinary evidence. That's what Carl Sagan said.\n\n\"There may be aliens in our Milky Way galaxy, and there are billions of other galaxies. The probability is almost certain that there is life somewhere in space.\n\n\"It was not that remarkable, that special, that unusual, that life here on earth evolved gradually, slowly, to where we are today.\"\n\n4 Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin, pictured left to right, were the crew of the Apollo 11 mission to the moon Credit: Alamy\n\nOn July 21, 1969, Neil Armstrong made history by becoming the first person to set foot on the earth\u2019s moon.\n\nUpon landing, he is famously quoted as saying: \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\"\n\nBuzz was on the same mission, Apollo 11, as Neil Armstrong and soon followed in his footsteps - making him the second man on the moon.\n\nIn total, Neil and Buzz were on the lunar surface for only 21 hours, 36 minutes and 21 seconds.\n\nPete Conrad was a moon walker on the Apollo 12 mission, which launched on November 14, 1969. He was partnered by Alan Bean.\n\nAlso on the Apollo 12 mission, was Alan Bean. He and Pete were on the moon for two days - November 19 and 20, 1969.", "images": ["https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newspress-collage-mr302u979-1753358349211.jpg?1753362009&strip=all&w=150&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000260562148.jpg?strip=all&w=612", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/themes/thesun/images/sunmasthead_mobile.svg", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000243467087.jpg?strip=all&w=960", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000001148105.jpg?strip=all&w=943", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newspress-collage-t5xp15pag-1752841952527.jpg?1752845647&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/KH_23_07_ALIEN_PROBE_COMP_542aa5.jpg?strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newspress-collage-n23nl3pl1-1753354097782.jpg?1753357719&strip=all&w=150&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/crop-35990944.jpg?strip=all&w=150&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/JA_Area_51_Fire_COMP_39f7d8.jpg?strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newspress-collage-o4b6bbvlc-1753360568286.jpg?1753364363&strip=all&w=150&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/themes/thesun/images/sunmasthead.svg", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HB-SPORT-PREVIEW-FELIX-GF.jpg?strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000019068298-e1523183787771.jpg?crop=0px%2C58px%2C1934px%2C1289px&resize=620%2C413", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000019068298.jpg?strip=all&w=763", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000019068298-e1523183787771.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1934px%2C1289px&resize=1920%2C1080"], "top_img": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000019068298-e1523183787771.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1934px%2C1289px&resize=1920%2C1080", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jay Akbar"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5999912/buzz-aldrin-ufo-lie-detector-test-alien-life-exists-convinced/", "title": "Buzz Aldrin \u2018passes UFO lie detector test leaving experts convinced that he encountered alien life\u2019", "meta_data": {"twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thesun"}, "robots": "noarchive,noodp,max-image-preview:large", "taboola": {"kicker": "OUT OF THIS WORLD", "headline": "Buzz Aldrin 'passes UFO lie detector test claiming he saw alien life'", "image": {"medium": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000019068298-e1523183787771.jpg?crop=0px%2C58px%2C1934px%2C1289px&resize=300%2C192", "large": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000019068298-e1523183787771.jpg?crop=0px%2C58px%2C1934px%2C1289px&resize=620%2C413"}}, "parsely-post-id": 5999912, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Buzz Aldrin 'passes UFO lie detector test leaving experts convinced alien life exists'", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5999912/buzz-aldrin-ufo-lie-detector-test-alien-life-exists-convinced/", "description": "LEGENDARY astronaut Buzz Aldrin passed a lie detector test over claims he\u2019s encountered alien life, reports claim.
