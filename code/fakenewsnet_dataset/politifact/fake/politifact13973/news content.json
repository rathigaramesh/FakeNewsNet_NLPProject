He set up a website, posted gushing stories about Hillary Clinton and waited for ad sales to soar.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why, but it did not work,\u201d said the student, Beqa Latsabidze, 22, who was savvy enough to change course when he realized what did drive traffic: laudatory stories about Donald J. Trump that mixed real \u2014 and completely fake \u2014 news in a stew of anti-Clinton fervor.\n\nMore than 6,000 miles away in Vancouver, a Canadian who runs a satirical website, John Egan, had made a similar observation. Mr. Egan\u2019s site, The Burrard Street Journal, offers sendups of the news, not fake news, and he is not trying to fool anyone. But he, too, discovered that writing about Mr. Trump was a \u201cgold mine.\u201d His traffic soared and his work, notably a story that President Obama would move to Canada if Mr. Trump won, was plundered by Mr. Latsabidze and other internet entrepreneurs for their own websites.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all Trump,\u201d Mr. Egan said by telephone. \u201cPeople go nuts for it.\u201d\n\nWith Mr. Obama now warning of the corrosive threat from fake political news circulated on Facebook and other social media, the pressing question is who produces these stories, and how does this overheated, often fabricated news ecosystem work?", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/26/world/26FAKE2/26FAKE2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=9660de641d2d62a26a688f50f4fbcc05c5cfc027a31af0249b35ff77fd4f203c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/26/world/26FAKE2/26FAKE2-articleInline.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/26/world/26FAKE2/26FAKE2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=9660de641d2d62a26a688f50f4fbcc05c5cfc027a31af0249b35ff77fd4f203c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrew Higgins", "Mike Mcintire", "Gabriel J.X.
