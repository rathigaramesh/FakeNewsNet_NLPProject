A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town\u2019s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.", "images": ["https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/jeffrey-epstein-mugshot-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/06/IMG_1360-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/GettyImages-2211093216-1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/dish-network-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1-640x480.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/ExMachina-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/03/Lutnick-319-Thumbnail-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/Jeffrey-Epstein-Ghislaine-Maxwell-05-Bill-and-Hillary-Clinton-92-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/spc-7-24-25-getty-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/GettyImages-2225419104-e1753356644400-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/John-Brennan-and-Hillary-Clinton-200x150.jpeg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/Reform-UK-on-the-charge-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/05/GettyImages-2213102183-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/obama-brennan-2013-getty-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/GettyImages-2225886408-1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/himes-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/beef-imports-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/GettyImages-2224760167-1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/GettyImages2225769398-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/joy-behar-responds-200x150.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ian Mason", "Ian Jan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.breitbart.com/live/state-union-fact-check-analysis-livewire/fact-check-no-falls-river-massachusetts-was-not-built-by-immigrants/", "title": "Fact-Check: No, Fall River, Massachusetts, Was Not \u2018Built by Immigrants\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=722987199", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.breitbart.app", "theme-color": "#FF5500", "ahrefs-site-verification": "e5213d6c4a07fe85baa34006f2a9a3c977bd8f3a50fd0ab6d2aa93844e0b3303", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Rep.
