That is, when the NFL Black Lives Don\u2019t Matter gang attacked patriotism and the US flag and most of the football fans, this blew up big time to the point, the frightened commissioner of this gang of thugs suddenly woke up and issued his first punishment for the people protesting at games: a million dollars each! I hope for two things: Villanueva is exempt plus since he was intimidated by both coach, the owner of the Steelers and fellow teammates, 50% of this fine should go to him! How about that?\n\n\n\nAlejandro Villanueva apologizes for throwing Steeler teammates \u2018under the bus\u2019 \u2013 YouTube\n\nKim of North Korea is now running the NFL, it appears. The abject apology of this poor football player is backfiring very badly. People are twice as angry as before. Now, the hatred of the \u2018other players\u2019 who dissed the American flag is not gone away, either. They demanded everyone join them in being anti-patriotic and now this poor guy is doing exactly that. The NFL is now in dire straits. Like the DNC, they think they can impose their ideology on everyone else via force. Well, it isn\u2019t working at all.\n\nAs I said above, Villanueva is the only member of that \u2018team\u2019 that stood up for America and he was then muscled by thugs threatening his life and livelihood and who forced him to do a miserable retraction of his good, patriotic deed. People are very angry at him for surrendering but then, he had everyone against him. Now, he should be rehabilitated, he needs a HUGE apology from the entire NFL leadership and his former teammates.\n\nFire chief apologizes for calling Steelers\u2019 coach Mike Tomlin \u2018n-word\u2019 on Facebook | TribLIVE\n\nChief Paul Smith, who leads Cecil\u2019s Volunteer Fire Department No. 2 in Muse, Washington County, posted the comment in response to the Steelers\u2019 decision not to not take the field for the national anthem. \u201cTomlin just added himself to the list of no good n-words. Yes I said it,\u201d Smith wrote in the post.Cecil\u2019s board of supervisors said the comment was troublesome. \u201cThe Cecil Township Board of Supervisors is deeply disturbed by the comments made by volunteer Chief Smith, and in no way, shape or form condone his comments,\u201d officials said in a written statement.\n\nSee? This man said something rash. He is immediately punished. The NFL players who decided to toss the US flag in the trash and attack the President for talking about their disrespect of the US voters and citizens\u2026they should also be punished heavily, no? Of course! Liberals think PC punishment is a one way street.\n\nThey can cuss, swear, be abusive, harass and even physically attack fellow citizens and nothing is done to stop this! But anyone else says the wrong words and they lose their jobs and are punished in many ways. This is causing tremendous ire and is the #1 reason many voted for Trump.\n\nNot One More Dime: NFL Stadiums Have Collected Over $1.1 Billion in Federal Subsidies \u2013 Time to Cut Them Off. Calls to stop the NFL gravy train is rising. Even if Goodell manages to muscle the teams into behaving themselves, it is not going to work for the fan base can see that the people playing the game really hate them and so this comrade business is kaput.\n\nAccording to FOX Sports over the last 20 years, the American public has spent more than $7 billion dollars to build or renovate NFL stadiums, taking on 46 percent of the total costs of those projects. It\u2019s time to cut them off. They don\u2019t respect the country. Why should the country respect them?\n\nThe coach of the Steelers sponsored Hillary\u2019s run for President. Note the loot she asked for, show up to see her, you had to pay $330000+. What a rip-off!\n\nPushing this pile of toothpaste back into the tube is impossible now. petition: CUT OFF ALL FEDERAL TAXPAYER SUBSIDIES TO NFL, PAYING BILLIONS TO LEAGUE. NO MORE . is one example.\n\nNFL gives up tax exempt status \u2013 Apr. 28, 2015 which was about time. But they still suck off the public teat via moving teams around while making demands for freebies like free stadiums, etc. NFL gets billions in subsidies from U.S. taxpayers \u2013 Jan. 30, 2015 despite being \u2018taxed\u2019 lightly.\n\nStadium construction: Twenty new NFL stadiums have opened since 1997 with the help of $4.7 billion in taxpayer funds, according to an analysis by the advisory firm Conventions, Sports and Leisure. Local governments pony up to build these venues to attract or keep teams in their towns. Two more stadiums now under construction in Minneapolis and Atlanta are being built with $700 million in government funds. Taxpayers paid for most of the University of Phoenix Stadium, which opened in 2006 and is home to this Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl \u2014 to the tune of about $300 million.\n\nAll this will go crashing down unless the team owners wake up and figure out who their audience really is. But then, the cities are being systematically destroyed\u2026", "images": ["https://emsnews.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/screen-shot-2017-09-26-at-9-48-47-am.png?w=500&h=432",
