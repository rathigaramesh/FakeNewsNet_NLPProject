They are the parents of Nisa Mickens and Kayla Cuevas, who had been close friends since elementary school, but in September 2016, the two girls were chased down and brutally murdered by MS-13.\n\nOn Tuesday night when the President honored the parents of Kayla and Nisa and the victims of illegal immigrant violence the Democrats groaned and booed.\n\nThis was a shocking display \u2013 even for today\u2019s Democrats.\n\nThe #SOTU has exposed the Democrats for what they are. They just booed the parents of a murdered child & they sat on their butts for the portion of the speech about respecting the National Anthem. Unreal. \u2014 Dan Bongino (@dbongino) January 31, 2018\n\nAwful.", "images": ["https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/gp_72125-1200x630.jpg", "http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tgpvideos-logo.png", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/parents-ms13-1200x630.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=20480112&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/ms-13-children-534x600.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-B7u53vryvwWEt.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22315475&cv=3.6.0&cj=1", "http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/gateway-hispanic-horizontal.png", "http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/ptn-logo.png", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/plugins/gtranslate/flags/24/es.png", "http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/americangulag-logo-plain.png", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/site-title-new-large2.png", "http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/tgptruth-logo.png", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/plugins/gtranslate/flags/24/ja.png", "http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/tgpfactcheck-logo-tagline3.png", "https://c.statcounter.com/9449268/0/3cc87ae0/0/", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/plugins/gtranslate/flags/24/pt.png", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/conference-sidebar.jpg", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-cropped-avatar-jim2-1-384x384.jpg", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/plugins/gtranslate/flags/24/en-us.png", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/plugins/gtranslate/flags/24/de.png"], "top_img": "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/parents-ms13-1200x630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jim Hoft", "Skip To Content", "Menu", "Gateway Hispanic Rino Watch American Gulag Tgp Videos Store Please Donate To The Gateway Pundit Get Ad Free Log In", "Register", "Log In", "Manage Account", "Cancel Account", "Home About Us", "About Us"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2018/01/stunning-democrats-boo-parents-girls-murdered-ms-13-killers-new-york-video/", "title": "STUNNING!
