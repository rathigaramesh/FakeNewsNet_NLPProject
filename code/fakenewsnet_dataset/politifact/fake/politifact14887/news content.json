Orrin Hatch (R-UT) stated that Trump had \u201cbeen one of the best presidents\u201d he ever served under.\n\nO\u2019Neal stated \u201cI\u2019m not aware of it. I don\u2019t pay much attention to his tweets. I\u2019ll say this for you. He\u2019s been one of the best presidents I\u2019ve served under.\u201d\n\nAND THE REASONING IS, HE\u2019S NOT AFRAID TO MAKE DECISIONS. HE\u2019S NOT AFRAID TO TAKE ON THE \u2014 THE BIG MOUTHS AROUND HERE.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Neal continued, \u201cThe president is smart, powerful and a good counterpuncher.I think he attacks anyone he perceives or believes is attacking him or the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe should be given the Medal of Freedom for talking his mind in such a bold, honest, and straightforward manner.\u201d O\u2019Neal added.\n\n\u201cTHE REALITY IS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO START FIGHTING FOR THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER WITH HIM INSTEAD OF CRITICIZING AND WASTING THEIR TIME ON STUPID THINGS.\u201d HE CONCLUDED.\n\nAnd Also What Ken Langone told CNBC:\n\nIf President Donald Trump is able to keep defying expectations \u2014 like he did in the election \u2014 and push through legislative changes against great odds, he could go down as \u201cone of our greatest presidents ever,\u201d Ken Langone told CNBC on Monday.\n\nLangone, a longtime Republican supporter and the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot, said the Trump presidency offers the GOP, which also controls the House and the Senate, a unique time to deliver on the reasons Americans voted for a political outsider for the White House.\n\nVoters are \u201cfed up,\u201d Langone said on \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d \u201cThey did a very dramatic, earth-shattering thing,\u201d and now want results, he said.\n\nLangone warned the Republicans that they could lose their majorities in the House and the Senate if lawmakers fail to seize this Trump-created opportunity. \u201cWe own the next 25 years as a nation [if we act].\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you guys don\u2019t get your guys into a room and say \u2018Guys this is our moment.\u2019 The American people will throw you out too, the next time,\u201d he warned House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy who also appeared as a guest Monday on \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Trump] has the capacity to go down as one of our greatest presidents ever\u201d if he\u2019s able to bring about big changes in health care, tax cuts and $1 trillion of infrastructure upgrades, Langone said.\n\n\u201cThe American people elected him president, in my mind, for one reason: they don\u2019t want incremental change. They want major change,\u201d said Langone, founder and CEO of investment bank Invemed Associates, specializing in health-care and high-technology companies\n\nThe Home Depot co-founder also came out in favor of the House GOP\u2019s border adjustment tax provision to help pay for their overall effort to cut corporate taxes.\n\n\n\nMany retailers are against the idea of taxing imports, saying it will force them to raise prices.\n\nBut Langone argued that retailers, like Home Depot, would be better off in the long term if they\u2019re able to \u201cthink beyond the next quarter or the next six months.\u201d\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/proconservativenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-06-01_053952-750x400.jpg?resize=80%2C80&ssl=1", "https://proconservativenews.com/wp-content/themes/flex-mag/images/logos/logo-foot.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/41ef0987e6c197627dc9488f4a7c8eb9?s=50&d=mm&r=g", "https://i2.wp.com/proconservativenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screenshot_6-1-850x550.jpg?resize=850%2C550&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/proconservativenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bee.png?resize=80%2C80&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.guerrilla.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2-1.png?resize=620%2C355&ssl=1", "https://proconservativenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gv.png", "https://i2.wp.com/proconservativenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bill.png?resize=80%2C80&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/proconservativenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/robert-mueller-demi-collusion.jpg?resize=80%2C80&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/proconservativenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/trump-1.png?resize=80%2C80&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/proconservativenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screenshot_6-1-850x550.jpg?resize=850%2C550&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sassy Laura", "Name"], "canonical_link": "https://proconservativenews.com/shaquille-oneal-says-trump-is-possibly-the-best-president-of-the-president-of-all-times-ever-he-is-not-afraid-to/", "title": "Shaquille O\u2019Neal Says: \u2018Trump Is Possibly The Best President Of The President Of All Times Ever, He Is Not Afraid To\u2026\u2019", "meta_data": {"fb": {"pages": 582678301941895}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/proconservativenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screenshot_6-1-850x550.jpg?fit=850%2C550&ssl=1", "width": 850, "height": 550}, "type": "article", "description": "Recently when he was asked about President Trump retweeting a couple of videos that made a big fuzz in the media, Sen.
