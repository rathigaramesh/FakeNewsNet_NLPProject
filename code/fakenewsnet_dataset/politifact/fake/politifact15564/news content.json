These right-wing judges don\u2019t think for themselves, they just do whatever the Constitution says. And it\u2019s time for that to end.\u201d\n\nSenate Democrats have vowed to make sure that any new nominee isn\u2019t going to be beholden to outside influences like the Constitution, the founding fathers, or the rule of law. \u201cWe need judges to be advocates of progressive laws,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren added. \u201cNot people who will bow to the whims of the Constitution, pitting its extremist values of freedom of speech and freedom of religion against our agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sick and tired of the Constitution sitting in the National Archives, manipulating everything we do,\u201d stated Senator Cory Booker, trying to emote for the cameras but failing. Booker then called a ten-minute recess for him to refresh his supply of fake tears before he could continue.\n\nAsked about their concerns, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he \u201cdoesn\u2019t care\u201d and plans to \u201ccompletely ignore\u201d the Democrats in the nomination process since \u201cthere\u2019s nothing they can do\u201d and he is \u201cliterally unstoppable.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180702132336im_/https://babylonbee.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/eo-218x150.jpg",
