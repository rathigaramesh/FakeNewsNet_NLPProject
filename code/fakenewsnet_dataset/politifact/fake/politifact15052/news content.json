One more was gunned down on the street, and two other victims died in hospital.\n\nThe school, which has about 3,200 students, remained on lockdown for about 90 minutes before students were finally released and reunited with their distraught parents - who were anxiously waiting for updates - in emotional scenes.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nCruz - described by former classmates as a \"troubled\" loner who was obsessed with guns - was arrested just after 4pm by police in nearby Coral Springs. He was wearing wine-colored Reserve Officers' Training Corps polo shirt, black pants and black boots.\n\nPolice said Cruz, who worked at a local discount store and was attending a new school, was armed with an AR-15 rifle and had multiple magazines of ammunition when he was arrested without a struggle.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nStudents were brought out of the school single file (Image: Getty Images North America)\n\nPolice wearing combat gear responded to the mass shooting (Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\nBrent Black, a former classmate, told ABC News that Cruz had previously threatened to go on a shooting spree at the school.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nHe said: \"About a year ago I saw him upset in the morning. And I was like, 'yo what\u2019s wrong with you?'\n\n\"And he was like 'umm, don\u2019t know.' And I was like 'what\u2019s up with you?'\n\n\"He's like, 'I swear to God I'll shoot up this school'. And then I was like, 'watch what you\u2019re saying around me', and then I just left him after that. He came up to me later on the day and apologised for what he said.\"\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nStudents told reporters that Cruz was familiar with the school's layout and had been involved in fire drills in the past, so he knew what to expect when the alarm went off.\n\nStudents gather outside the school after being released from a lockdown (Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\nParents were desperate for updates before their children were released (Image: Getty Images North America)\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nAttorney Jim Lewis told the South Florida Sun Sentinel that the AR-15 used in the mass shooting was legally bought by Cruz, who lived with a family friend following his mum Lynda 's death.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nA source told CNN that Cruz had purchased the gun in the past year after passing a background check.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nCruz's adoptive mum died in November at age 68 from pneumonia, while his dad Roger died from a heart attack when he was a younger boy, it was reported.\n\nThe couple had reportedly adopted Cruz on the day he was born, along with his biological brother, Zachary.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the family friend, Lewis said: \u201cIt was his gun. The family made him keep it in a locked gun cabinet in the house but he had a key.\u201d\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nLewis said the family let Cruz move in around Thanksgiving, gave him a room and urged him to attend adult education classes.\n\nParents hug as they wait for updates from authorities (Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\nThe lawyer said Cruz was \"depressed\" following his mum's death, and the family who took him in \"didn\u2019t see this coming\".\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nA relative told US media that Cruz had been diagnosed with autism.\n\nFollowing his arrest, Cruz was questioned for hours by detectives before he was charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder. Officers searched a number of properties linked to the suspect, including the home where he was living with a family friend.\n\nThe FBI and Department of Homeland Security were assisting with the investigation.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nFormer classmates claim he had previously threatened to shoot up the school, he had talked about shooting animals and he was obsessed with guns.\n\nThey also said he had a bad school record and was expelled from Douglas High School after getting into a fight with his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend.\n\nBroward County School District Superintendent Robert Runcie told reporters he did not know of any threats posed by Cruz to the school.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nPolice and fire rescue vehicles parked near the scene (Image: AFP)\n\nBut maths teacher Jim Gard told the Miami Herald that he believes the school had sent out an email warning teachers that Cruz should not be allowed on campus with a backpack.\n\nHe added: \"There were problems with him last year threatening students, and I guess he was asked to leave campus.\"\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nPhotos posted on Cruz's Instagram account showed him posing with guns and knives. Police have described the social media posts as \u201cvery, very disturbing\".\n\nIt also emerged that a YouTube user called 'Nikolas Cruz' had written chilling comments on videos just months ago.\n\nOne comment under a documentary about the 1966 Texas University massacre read \"I am going to what he did\" [sic].\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nA YouTube comment by a user named 'Nikolas Cruz' (Image: YouTube)\n\nAnother YouTube user claims someone with the handle 'Nikolas Cruz' commented on one of his videos last year, writing: \"I want to be a professional school shooter.\"\n\nThe FBI were alerted to that post in September and carried out an investigation, but it was unclear what, if anything, happened from there.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nWhen Cruz was a freshman he was part of the US military-sponsored Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corp programme at the school.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, Jillian Davis, 19, a recent graduate who was in the programme with Cruz, recalled his \"strange talking sometimes about knives and guns\", but said \"no one ever took him seriously\".\n\nChad Williams, 18, described Cruz as \"kind of an outcast\" who was \"crazy about guns\" and was known for unruly behavior at school, including a penchant for pulling false fire alarms.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n,'Everyone predicted it':, Chilling insight from pupil on school shooter\n\nTrevor Hart, who had been in a Spanish class with Cruz, told the Orlando Sentinel that the 19-year-old seemed \"a little off\" and had talked about shooting lizards, squirrels and frogs.\n\nFormer schoolmate Alex Azar told CBS Miami: \"He always seemed like the unstable type, the type who would do this sort of thing. He was always in the office. He was always in trouble, very unstable. He had that look to him, kind of sinister.\"\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nFormer neighbour Shelby Speno told how police were called to Cruz's home numerous times and he had been seen shooting at a fellow neighbour's chickens.\n\nAnother former neighbour, Janine Kartiganer, added: \u201cHe wore a hoodie and always had his head down. He looked depressed.\u201d\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nWednesday's shooting ranked as the ninth-deadliest mass shooting in modern US history and the second-deadliest act of gun violence ever on a US public school campus, behind the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012.\n\nTributes are left after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012 (Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nIn that incident, deranged gunman Adam Lanza, 20, killed 20 children aged six and seven and six adult staff members after killing his mum Nancy at their home in the town.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nLanza shot and killed himself as emergency services arrived at the scene.\n\nThe number of school shootings in the US has steadily increased in recent years, and the Parkland shooting is just the latest chapter in the longtime debate over preventative measures, including gun control.\n\nThere were fresh calls for the US government to do more to prevent similar tragedies.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nUS President Donald Trump didn't mention any potential preventative measures in his response to the attack.\n\nHe appeared to suggest that those who were aware of the warning signs didn't do enough to alert authorities beforehand.\n\nHe wrote on Twitter: \"So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!\"\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nAn AR-15-style assault rifle (Image: Photodisc)\n\nIn earlier tweets, he wrote: \"My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting. No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.\n\n\"Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott. We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting.\"\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nReports from the US indicated that local police had dealt with Cruz on several occasions, he had been kicked out of school and staff were warned about him, and the FBI had investigated the \"professional school shooter\" comment that appeared to be posted by him on YouTube.\n\nAs well, CNN reported that Cruz was able to purchase an assault rifle after passing a background check.\n\nJoe Melita, former head of the Professional Standards & Special Investigative Unit at Broward County Public Schools, told Action News Jax that that several district security officials were aware of Cruz\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nHe added: \u201cThey were familiar with who the young man was.\u201d\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden tweeted: \"I am at a loss for what more to say. I grieve with the families in Parkland today. I grieve with the families across the country who have suffered loss due to gun violence. Congress has a moral obligation to take action and spare more families from this violence.\"\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nMeanwhile there have been 18 school shootings in the US already this year, an average of one every 2.5 days. At this time last year there had been seven, US media reported.\n\nAccording to Gun Violence Archive, there have been 30 mass shootings since January 1, or one every 1.5 days.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nWednesday's school shooting occurred about 20 months after mass killer Omar Mateen, 29, murdered 49 people at a gay nightclub, called Pulse, in Orlando Florida. His rampage ended when he was shot dead by police.\n\nThe June 2016 massacre was the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history until gunman Stephen Paddock, 64, killed 58 people at a country music festival in Las Vegas last October.\n\nPaddock shot and killed himself before police stormed the Mandalay Bay hotel room he had used into a sniper's perch.", "images":
