On Wednesday, the Dead Petz singer continued lobbying against the GOP frontrunner with a photo of Trump\u2019s delegate totals over Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and a caption where Cyrus playfully threatened to move out of the country if Trump is elected and a hashtag #aintapartyindausaanymo.\n\nDonald Trump is a fucking nightmare!

I just think that he\u2019s a silly reality-show bozo and blustering guy who likes getting attention. I don\u2019t think he wants to be president, and I don\u2019t think he has a chance to be the president. He\u2019s just some egotistical, silly person whose main concern in life is getting a blowjob. He wants to be on TV and he wants everyone to thinks he\u2019s important.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-230573-donald_cyrus01.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-230573-donald_cyrus01.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Kreps", "Politics", "Blogherads.Adq.Push Function", "Blogherads", ".Defineslot", "'Inlineoop'", ".Settargeting", "'Pos'", ".Setsubadunitpath", "Article"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/miley-cyrus-donald-trump-is-a-f-king-nightmare-233843/", "title": "Miley Cyrus: \u2018Donald Trump Is a F\u2013king Nightmare\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Faced with the prospect of a President Trump, Miley Cyrus turned to Instagram to tell her 38 million followers, \"Donald Trump is a fucking nightmare!\"", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.2", "author": "Daniel Kreps", "tags": "Donald Trump, Miley Cyrus", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Miley Cyrus: 'Donald Trump Is a F--king Nightmare'", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/miley-cyrus-donald-trump-is-a-f-king-nightmare-233843/", "description": "Faced with the prospect of a President Trump, Miley Cyrus turned to Instagram to tell her 38 million followers, \"Donald Trump is a fucking nightmare!\"", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-230573-donald_cyrus01.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1", "width": 1401, "height": 788, "alt": "Miley Cyrus; Donald Trump"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-02T19:05:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T20:20:17+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Faced with the prospect of a President Trump, Miley Cyrus turned to Instagram to tell her 38 million followers, \"Donald Trump is a fucking nightmare!\"", "site": "@RollingStone", "creator": "@danielkreps", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Miley Cyrus: \u2018Donald Trump Is a F\u2013king Nightmare\u2019", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-230573-donald_cyrus01.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/R-Avatar_512x512_flat.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1456945500.0, "source": "https://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
