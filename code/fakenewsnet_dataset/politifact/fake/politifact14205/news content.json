I am not certain where he is now, but in 2013, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.\u201d\n\nMr. Snowden says the CIA orchestrated the fake death of the former leader of Al Qaeda, while he was actually transported with his family in an undisclosed location in the Bahamas.\n\n\u201cOsama Bin Laden was one of the CIA\u2019s most efficient operatives for a long time,\u201d claims the famous whistleblower. \u201cWhat kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody\u2019s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.\u201d\n\nMr. Snowden says that the documents proving that Bin Laden is still alive will be integrally reproduced in his new book, expected to be released in September.\n\nEdward Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor in 2013 after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. In the month of June of the same year, he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists.\n\nThe US government filed espionage charges against him shortly after his revelations were made public. He has been living under asylum in Moscow, after fleeing the US for Hong Kong in the wake of the leaks.\n\nOn July 28 2015, the White House has rejected a \u201cWe the People\u201d petition of nearly 168,000 signatories, to pardon him.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20150827034000im_/http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/snowden.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150827034000im_/http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/snowden-60x54.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150827034000im_/http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bill-clinton-ashley-60x54.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150827034000im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/4922eede87df397ec9d6f6e49a3c555a?s=80&d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D80&r=G", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150827034000im_/http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/snowden3.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150827034000im_/http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/snowden2.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150827034000im_/http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/erdogan-gay-60x54.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150827034000im_/http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/china-market-60x54.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150827034000im_/http://logv4.xiti.com/bcg.xiti?s=538534&p="], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150827034000im_/http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/snowden.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mbesuma Says", "Name"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150827034000/http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/bin-laden-is-alive-and-well-in-the-bahamas-says-edward-snowden/", "title": "Bin Laden is \"Alive and well in the Bahamas\", says Edward Snowden", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.8", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "World News Daily Report", "title": "Bin Laden is \"Alive and well in the Bahamas\", says Edward Snowden", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150827034000/http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/bin-laden-is-alive-and-well-in-the-bahamas-says-edward-snowden/", "type": "article", "description": "Moscow| National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden, has made\u00a0a new\u00a0controversial claim yesterday, saying that he possessed some classified information proving that Osama Bin Laden is st", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150827034000im_/http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/snowden.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
