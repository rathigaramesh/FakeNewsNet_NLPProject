Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. \u201cWe thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there\u2019s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting\u201d, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. \u201cThey are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal\u201d, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. \u201cHopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern\u201d, said Dr. Polowotski. \u201cBoaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution\u201d. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. \u201cWe were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it\u201d, said Bob. \u201cWe were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow. But something like this really does make you stop and think\u201d, he said. DNR officials removed the animal from the beach and took it to an undisclosed location for further study.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171114041214im_/http://www.breakingnews365.net/cache/images/d/5/d/1/9/d5d19f68b8cb821683d4650657aa41747e379506.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171114041214im_/http://www.breakingnews365.net/cache/images/7/d/1/b/4/7d1b4caaf74875be47e00ce31951984c90730c42.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171114041214im_/http://www.breakingnews365.net/cache/images/2/b/2/d/5/2b2d54671ac1c59422198cf2ac88bff97f62a0ec.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171114041214im_/http://www.breakingnews365.net/cache/images/c/3/a/0/0/c3a007bc4e33e0edef36e1e6225fce779541ac56.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171114041214im_/http://www.breakingnews365.net/cache/images/b/7/1/6/d/b716d0deab412712adab6294d48bd178f9a8d219.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171114041214im_/http://www.breakingnews365.net/cache/images/7/d/1/b/4/7d1b4caaf74875be47e00ce31951984c90730c42.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171114041214/http://www.breakingnews365.net/5a00d7972338f/snapchat-is-shutting-down.html", "title": "Snapchat is shutting down!", "meta_data": {"description": "Snapchat will be shutting down tommrow for the U.K. , and will shut down today for the U.s , such a shame", "keywords": "Breaking News, Daily News and Videos", "og": {"title": "Snapchat is shutting down!", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171114041214/http://www.breakingnews365.net/5a00d7972338f/snapchat-is-shutting-down.html", "site_name": "BreakingNews365.net", "description": "Snapchat will be shutting down tommrow for the U.K. , and will shut down today for the U.s , such a shame", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171114041214im_/http://www.breakingnews365.net/cache/images/7/d/1/b/4/7d1b4caaf74875be47e00ce31951984c90730c42.jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 820, "height": 400}}, "author": "BreakingNews365.net", "robots": "index, follow", "rating": "general", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
